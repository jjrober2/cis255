<h1>This page will demonstrate the varying pros and cons of boostrap versus Wordpress.</h1>
<h3>I will also showcase several classes that can be found useful, which can help ease the web design process.</h3>

<p>Some of the Bootsrap classes used for the website:</p>


<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<p>I used the primary button type to show prominence, and to display a bold style that was easy for the user to notice.</p>

<span class="badge badge-primary">Primary</span>
<p>I used the primary badge to show a subtle prominence that still draws the user's attention to the display.</p>


<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="formGroupExampleInput">Example label</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="formGroupExampleInput" placeholder="Example input">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="formGroupExampleInput2">Another label</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="formGroupExampleInput2" placeholder="Another input">
  </div>
</form>
<p>I used the form labels to indicate to the user they would be entering information in a familiar way.</p>


<table class="table table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>#</th>
      <th>First Name</th>
      <th>Last Name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>Mark</td>
      <td>Otto</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>Jacob</td>
      <td>Thornton</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>I used the hover table to display the brands covered under warranty, to show them in a neat outline, and I used the hover technique to draw some focus when the user is perusing through the list.</p>

<p>
  <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
    Link with href
  </a>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
    Button with data-target
  </button>
</p>
<div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
  <div class="card card-body">
    Anim pariatur cliche reprehenderit, enim eiusmod high life accusamus terry richardson ad squid. Nihil anim keffiyeh helvetica, craft beer labore wes anderson cred nesciunt sapiente ea proident.
  </div>
</div>
<p>I used the collapse list class so the user had the option to hide additional information, in attempts to make the web page more brief.</p>

<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1 class="display-3">Hello, world!</h1>
  <p class="lead">This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for
                  calling extra attention to featured content or information.</p>
  <hr class="my-2">
  <p>It uses utility classes for typography and
     spacing to space content out within the larger container.</p>
  <p class="lead">
    <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#!" role="button">Some action</a>
  </p>
</div>
<p>I used the large jumbotron for the about section because I thought it lended well to catching the user's attention and it gave a nice heading.</p>

<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
  <div class="container">
    <h1 class="display-3">Fluid jumbotron</h1>
    <p class="lead">This is a modified jumbotron that occupies
                    the entire horizontal space of its parent.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>I used the more subtle jumbotron for the remainder of the website to keep the size consistent, but to allow it to have less prominence than the about section.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <strong>Heads up!</strong> This alert needs your attention,
    but it's not super important.
</div>
<p>I used the alert info to showcase some drop down sections that provided extra information for the user that was pleasing to the eyes.</p>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button>
<p>I used the primary button outline for the home button at the bottom of the page to indicate importance without taking precedence away from the main content.</p>

<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
<p>I used the container class to keep the home button consistent with the rest of the page</p>

<div class="shadow-sm p-3 mb-5 bg-light rounded">Small Shadow shadow</div>
<p>I used the shadow to provide some bottom depth to the home return button.</p>

<h3>Wordpress VS Bootstrap</h3>
<p>Versus is a little deceiving, because Wordpress and Boostrap are completely
different animals. Wordpress is more intuitive for anyone who is just starting
out with web design. For example, manipulatiing objects in windows, or customizing 
preferences by clicking buttons and getting immediate feedback can be more helpful
for someone who is just starting out.
</p>
<p>Bootstrap however gives you all of the necessary tools, and then some. You are 
able to manipulate the tinest details with Bootstrap, that I feel you don't
get the same control with wordpress. I am able to create my own container, or
use an existing one, and insert any custimization of code and have it look
and feel responsive in a way that matches or exceeds Wordpress.</p>
